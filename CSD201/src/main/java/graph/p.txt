// 1    Create text files to store the adjancy matrix of a graph in Figure 1.
// Write the Graph class with  the following members:
// Data members:
// int [][] a  -  two dimentional array representing an adjancy matrix
// String [] label - label of vertices
// int n - number of vertices.
// Methods:
// void setAMatrix(int [][] b, int m) - set m to n and b matrix to adjancy matrix.
// void setLabel(String [] c) - set labels for vertices 
// and two methods for breadth first traverse and depth first traverse.
// 2.   Write the WGraph class which contains weighted matrix and methods for Dijkstra shortest path algorithm.
// 3.   Write the WGraph class which contains weighted matrix and methods for  finding  the minimum spanning tree  of  a graph.
// 4.   Write the Graph class which contains adjacency matrix and methods for  assigning colors to vertices with the sequential coloring algorithm.
